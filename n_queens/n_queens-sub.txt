Assigment name: n_queens
Expected files: *.c *.h
Allowed functions: atoi, fprintf, write, calloc, malloc, free, realloc, stdout, stderr

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program that will print all the solutions to the n_queens problem for a 
n given as argument.

We will not test with negative values.
The order of the solutions is not important.

You will display solutions under the following format:
<p1><p2><p3>...\n
where pn are the line index of the queen in each column starting from 0.

For example this should work:
$> ./n_queens 2 | cat -e
$> ./n_queens 4 | cat -e
1 3 0 2$
2 0 3 1$

The Eight Queens Problem
One of the classical problems connected with a chess-board is determination of 
the number of ways in which eight queens can be placed on a board of n2 (n squared)
cells so that no queens can take any other.
